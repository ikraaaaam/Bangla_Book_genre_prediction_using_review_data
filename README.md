## Bangla_Book_genre_prediction_using_review_data Overview
- It was a multiclass classification task.
- Created a tool that can categorizes the Bengali Book Reviews into 7 diffferent categories (**`Fiction (0), Thriller (1), Childrens-Book (2), Political (3), Science-Fiction (4), War (5), and Motivational (6)`**) using **Deep Learning(NLP)**
- It was a NLP competition and dataset was hosted in kaggle [dataset]([https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xp92jxr8wn/2](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-competition-cuet-ete-day-2023/data)https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-competition-cuet-ete-day-2023/data)
- - **`Word embeeding`** feature represtations technique is used for extracting the semantic meaning of the words.
- A deep learning model has been built by using a **`CNN - LSTM and also TF-IDF and ML classifiers`**.
- A combination of TF-IDF and Logistic Regression gave the highest 'Macro-F1 score'
- The model performance is evaluated using various evaluation measures such as **` accuracy , precision, recall and macro f1-score`**.
